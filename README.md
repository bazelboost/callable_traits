# Boost.CallableTraits

CallableTraits is a standalone C++11 header-only library for the inspection, synthesis, and decomposition of callable types. Language features added in later C++ standards are also supported.

The latest documentation is available [here](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/callable_traits/doc/html/index.html).

CallableTraits was [formally reviewed](http://www.boost.org/community/reviews.html) and [accepted](https://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2017/04/234513.php) into the [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/). CallableTraits is available in Boost 1.66 and later. Since CallableTraits has no dependencies, you can also download it as a standalone library [here](https://github.com/boostorg/callable_traits/releases/latest).
